Things todo:
  - date stuff:
    - date/last update isn't being calculated correctly. It's sort of "good enough" for now
    - Possibly improve colors of the "latest/time", not sure if they're all correct
    - what is better to use, update time or pub time?

  - getting the feed image from the feed url isn't quite working
  - limit max width
  - Fade text in truncated line mod
  - certain feeds are coming up as having no entities, but I think they should be there
